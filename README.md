# Absolute_point_method_Stream_delineation

This script delineates single streams from an arbitrary starting point towards the lowest point in the input dataset. Please make sure to use a vector-point dataset as input. In this version, the xyz-coordinates should be in the attribute table of this input point dataset in respectively the fith, sixth and seventh column. In the first section, some parameters have te be set up. Then, the search angle is defined to implement in the field calculator. A point is selected and the expression for the field calculator is executed to select the lowest point within the specified search radius. If the z-value of strarting point is lower than the end point, the extended search radius will be applied. This process is iterated until the model is at the lowest point in the dataset.
